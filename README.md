# Work Portfolio

## Description

This is my work portfolio. It will show you all the information you will know to get a gauge on my coding abilities. There is an about me section that summarizes my experiences and education. There will also be a work section that shows you all of the project that I have done. Finally, you'll find contact information to get in touch with me. 

My motivation for this project is to have space to show off my work and abilities in coding to employers when I am seeking out new oppurtunities. I built this project because I needed a website to store all my information in one single space. What I learned from buildilng this website is the use of flex boxes and css styling. I was able to create an responsive website that can adapt to different screen sizing. Also the css styling make it look pretty.
